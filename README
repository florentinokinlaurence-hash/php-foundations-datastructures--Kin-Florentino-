Project Purpose

This project aims to:

Use Recursion to display nested book categories and subcategories.

Use Hash Tables (associative arrays) to store and retrieve book information such as author, year, and genre.

Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) to insert, search, and display book titles in alphabetical order.

These concepts help improve understanding of PHP data structures and logical problem-solving.

How to Run Each Part

Part I — Recursion (recursion.php)

Displays book categories in a hierarchical structure.

How to run:

Fantasy
Harry Potter
The Hobbit
Mystery
Sherlock Holmes
Gone Girl
Non-Fiction

Becoming

Part II — Hash Table (hashtable.php)

Part III — Binary Search Tree (bst.php)

Inserts book titles, searches for specific titles, and displays them alphabetically.

Becoming
Gone Girl
Harry Potter
Sherlock Holmes
The Hobbit

Searching for "The Hobbit": Found
Searching for "Inferno": Not Found
